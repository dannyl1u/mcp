# Sample Documents for GraphRAG Example

This folder contains sample documents used by the `basic_example.py` script to demonstrate GraphRAG functionality.

## Documents

- **`artificial_intelligence.txt`** - Overview of AI, machine learning, and deep learning technologies
- **`climate_change.txt`** - Information about climate change impacts, mitigation, and adaptation strategies  
- **`digital_transformation.txt`** - Discussion of digital transformation accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic

## Usage

These documents are automatically loaded by the basic example script when you run:

```bash
python basic_example.py
```

You can replace these files with your own documents to test GraphRAG with different content. The system supports text files and will process them to build a knowledge graph for querying.

## File Format

- Files should be in plain text format (`.txt`)
- UTF-8 encoding is recommended
- No specific length requirements, but larger documents will take longer to process
